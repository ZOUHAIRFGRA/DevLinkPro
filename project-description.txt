Okay, here's a full project description for "DevLink" (our placeholder name), your Next.js platform for matching developers.

## DevLink: Project Description

---

### 1. Project Overview

**Name:** DevLink (Placeholder)

**Concept:** DevLink is a dynamic web platform designed to connect developers with projects and collaborators, functioning like a "Tinder for Devs." It aims to bridge the gap for developers looking to find partners for side projects, contribute to open-source, learn new technologies together, or bring project ideas to life.

**Goal:** To create an efficient, trustworthy, and engaging environment where developers can easily discover relevant projects and skilled collaborators, fostering innovation and shared learning within the developer community.

**Target Audience:**
* Software developers of all skill levels (students, juniors, seniors, specialists).
* Individuals or groups with project ideas needing development talent.
* Developers seeking to join existing projects for portfolio building, skill enhancement, or contribution.

**Core Value Proposition:**
* **Efficient Matching:** Quickly find relevant projects or developers through an intuitive swipe-based interface and AI-powered suggestions.
* **Focused Collaboration:** Connect for specific projects without the long-term commitments of co-founding a company or the formalities of employment.
* **Skill Confidence:** A basic skill verification system aims to provide a baseline level of trust in listed abilities.

    * **F3.2: Small Coding Challenges (Optional initial focus):** Simple, auto-graded coding tasks for specific technologies (e.g., "Write a function to X").
    * **F3.3: Verified Skill Badges:** Display badges on profiles for successfully completed verifications.
* **F4: Project Posting & Management:**
    * **F4.1: Create Project:** Form to describe the project idea, current status/progress, goals, technologies used/planned.
    * **F4.2: Define Roles Needed:** Specify skills required, desired experience level, and commitment expectations for collaborators.
    * **F4.3: Project Dashboard:** View and manage owned projects, applicants, and collaborators.

    * **F5.3: AI-Powered Suggestions (Initial Heuristics):** Initial matching based on skill overlap, interests, and project requirements.
    * **F5.4: Swipe Interface:** Users (both developers looking for projects and projects looking for devs) can swipe right ("interested") or left ("not interested") on profiles/projects.
* **F6: Connection & Communication:**
    * **F6.1: Mutual Match Notification:** When both parties express interest (e.g., project owner swipes right on a dev who swiped right on the project), a match is made.
    * **F6.2: In-App Chat:** Basic real-time messaging functionality for matched users to discuss collaboration.
* **F7: User Dashboard:**
    * **F7.1: Overview:** Summary of active projects, pending matches, new messages.
    * **F7.2: Profile Management:** Easy access to edit their developer profile.
    * **F7.3: Project Management:** Access to projects they've created or joined.

### 3. Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS (or another CSS framework/library)
* **Backend:** Next.js (API Routes)
* **Database:** MongoDB
* **Authentication:** NextAuth.js
* **AI/Matching:** Python service with a simple NLP/rules-based engine initially (can be expanded later), or embedded logic within Next.js API routes for simpler heuristic matching.
* **Deployment:** Vercel (ideal for Next.js), AWS, or other cloud provider.

### 4. Sprints & Task Breakdown

This is a suggested breakdown. Sprints are typically 2-4 weeks.

#### Sprint 0: Project Setup & Foundational Backend (1-2 Weeks)
**Goal:** Get the project environment ready and core backend structures in place.
* **Tasks:**
    1.  Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript.
    2.  Set up ESLint, Prettier, and Husky for code quality.
    3.  Choose and set up a database (e.g., PostgreSQL instance).
    4.  Design initial database schema for Users, Skills, and Projects.
    5.  Implement basic ORM or database client (e.g., Prisma, Drizzle ORM, or node-postgres).
    6.  Set up project structure (folders for components, pages, API, utils, etc.).
    7.  Basic CI/CD pipeline setup (e.g., GitHub Actions for Vercel deployment).

#### Sprint 1: Core Authentication & User Profiles (MVP - 2-3 Weeks)
**Goal:** Users can sign up, log in, and create/edit basic profiles.
* **Tasks:**
    1.  Integrate NextAuth.js.
    2.  Implement GitHub OAuth (F1.1).
